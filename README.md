<h2>What is this page for?</h2>
<p>This page was created  to be able to share their coding projects with the rest of the college and maby even start projects together, it also has a hub where the students will have all the link needed in one place to create maximun efficiency when taking notes in class<br>
Teachers can also have files uploaded onto here which makes the downloading files so much easier and faster.</p>

<p>We hope in the future we can have a database hosted then we can create logins and teacher classrooms for teachers and students to upload their projects and files. <br>
